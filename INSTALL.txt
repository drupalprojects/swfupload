SWFUpload module
         
DESCRIPTION:
********************************************************************

This module replaces the upload form with the SWFUpload interface as seen on
http://swfupload.mammon.se and handles the upload through javascript/flash. 
It depends on the core upload module and degrades gracefully to a normal HTML 
upload form if flash or javascript is unavailable.


INSTALLATION:
********************************************************************


1. Place the entire swfupload directory into your Drupal modules/
   directory.

   
2. Download SWFUpload from

   http://swfupload.mammon.se

   Remember to uncompress the file and make sure the folder is named
   'swfupload'.

   
3. Place the entire 'swfupload' engine folder inside your modules/swfupload
   directory. So the SWFUpload engine will live in modules/swfupload/swfupload
